## Personal update
These past few weeks have been really busy for work, I have been learngin an re-learning AWS ecosystem for deploying my Docker images using ECR & ECS .. while I haven fully grasp lots of concepts yet, I have been watching a lot of youtube videos and reading lots of blogs to lear how to setup my ECS cluster for deployments.
Right now, we are using some shell scripts to manually deploy the microservices, but I have been reading on Pulumi & Terraform, I haven't done anything to automate it with those tools yet, but because we are constantly deploying microservices, I think we'll need to eventually set time to learn those tools to make deployments easier.

## Hacktoberfest
Because I've been busy with work, I haven't had the time to look at hacktober projects, but none the less, I have my personal  projects that I've been working on, the idea was to finish the project by this month, but because I've been busy with work, I haven't had the time to finish my other project, hopefully I'll be able to finish it this year.. if I don't get any busier ... 

That is all for this week.
