# I'm back

Long time no post, but I was really busy with work and because we had a major release by the end of january, I couldn't find the time to write, I haven't even find the time to learn new things, I have only been reading on `laravel` stuff that I need for work, and some stuff related to its architecture because we are running on Laravel 8, not everything can be implemented as we want it.

Anyways, seems like I`ll have a bit of free time in the upcoming days, so I have been preparing a youtube playlist of things I want to learn, this year I will try to focus on devops stuff, but I also want to focus on finishing my personal projects, like my japanese blog, and my laravel side-project that I almost have the MVP ready but still needs some polish.

I'm still looking for a new job, this year I'm not aiming for japan, because it seems like they are requiring N3, and I'm still at N4 level, can't quite get to N3 yet...

In the upcoming days I'll post about stuff I'm learing, starting with `Nx` which is a monorepo, build system, I have used it before, but it was configured by someone else, they just had a major release this past week, so I think its a good time to start learning it, I'm also aiming to learn a little of `rust`, heard good things about the language and for devpos, I'm thinkig of terraform, but I also just read about pulumi ... I know terraform is industry standard, but from what I read pulumi has an easier learing curve.

Anyways thats it for my update.
