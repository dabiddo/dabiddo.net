### No news this week

This was a very interesting week, I've been applying to various companies, looking for a new place to work, but this week I had several initial interviews, and that is good, because I thought there was no place for a PHP developer in this NodeJs / Python world ... but as it turns out there are companies looking for experienced PHP developers ... just wish there was a Japanese company interested in hiring me  ... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### New Blog

As stated in my past blog-posts, I have created a new blog in Japanese, this blog will serve as practice for my studies, and it will focus on presenting Mexico to Japanese people, maybe that way I can get more japanese to get interested in coming to Mexico.</br>

This blog is also made with Astro, but uses Tailwind as the CSS, this has helped me refresh my knowledge of frontend, and has also helped me remember why I don't like doing Frontend work .. 

And this has been my update for the week.
