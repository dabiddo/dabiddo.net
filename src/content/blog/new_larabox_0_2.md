## New Larabox 0.2

This pas week, the new Laravel 12 was release with lots of changes, including the new laravel installer for the new starter kits, as such I had to upgrade my larabox project with the new wizard

The upgrade process was easy, because I am using a PHP 8.3 base image, all I really needed to do was delete my current docker image, and build a new one.

Here is the link to the project:
