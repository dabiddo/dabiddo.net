## salutations

It's been a while since I last wrote on my blog, but you know how life is: got fired, found a new job, and I've been busy with new projects. That hasn’t stopped me from being on Mastodon or watching a video tutorial now and then, but I haven't had the time or the right mentality to write here until now.

## Moving forward

During my time away, I started getting bored with the current layout. To spice things up, I decided to revamp the site with a new BIOS/terminal-inspired design, keeping some of the original code so I don't introduce breaking changes that would give me a headache later on.

I've also been consuming a lot of content regarding personal privacy, so I’m currently in the middle of "de-Googling" my life. While I'm not doing it all at once, I am making progress and will be sharing more about that in upcoming posts.

It feels good to be writing again. Thanks for sticking around through the silence—more updates coming soon!
