Hello, I haven´t been able to post anything new because I've been busy doing take home tests for job interviews I've been having lately.

### Interesting stuff
During these take home tests, there was a project I had to build both front and backend, ofcourse the backend API was built with Laravel, and the front was built with Nuxt 3, this is the 1st time I had to deploy a Nuxt App to "production", but I learned a lot, I already knew how to use PM2, but the way Nuxt does the built, presented some issues I never faced before, thankfully the Nuxt.com documentation, already gives a basic PM2 config to run the project, I had to google the rest on how to make the .env load, but in the end, I had it working and was happy with how it turned out.

#### Did I get the job?
No ... `(｡╯︵╰｡)` , but I did learn a lot and had the opportunity to get better at Nuxt-3 so I'll keep trying.

### It continues
During the little free time I've had lately, I've continued with learning Rust, I can proudly say I now know how to do functions, and how pass variables by reference, I'm thinking of doing really small excercise projects to get more familiar, but I don´t want to get sidetracked from finishing the Rust book, so I might postpone that 'till later.

### JLTP is coming...
As for my japanese lessons, I continue learning, but because I haven´t had the time to do any extra learning, I notice i'm forgetting stuff, and seeing as this July is the JLPT, its my countdown to shift into gear and do an extra effort with my japanese solo studying, so I'm working on a study plan to be ready for the december exam.

That is it for these few weeks updates...
