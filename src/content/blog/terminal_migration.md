# New Look

I recently migrated from the [terminal.xyz](https://terminalcss.xyz/) theme to the new terminal CSS by [panr](https://panr.github.io/terminal-css/). While I was generally satisfied with the `terminal.xyz` skin, I found its handling of <h> tags somewhat lacking, as there was little visual distinction between them. Additionally, customizing colors proved to be a bit cumbersome. The new CSS stylesheet offers a much more streamlined approach to modifying colors, fonts, and even the rendering of various elements.

## Not Over Yet

Since this was a quick migration, there are still a few issues left to address—such as improving how bullet points are rendered, hiding the `tags` from posts, and cleaning up some duplicated code in the blog list rendering. I’ll be working on squashing these bugs over the next few days. For now, my main goal was to establish the overall look and feel with the new terminal CSS.
