As the title says, I'm writing from my formatted computer using Debian 12.5, why? you asked...
I was impacted by the KDE-Neon upgrade issue a few days back, I lost all my configuration settings and other weird bugs present after the upgrade,
so I took it a sign to change distros, so I did a backup of my important files and installed Debian 12.5 with GNOME

I'm quite happy how its turning out, all though I'm having some issues like not able to install the `tabby` CLI which I really like, but at least now I feel my laptop is crazy fast to boot and since I use docker for all my programming needs, having my blog up and running was a matter of installing docker and VSCode and we were back in business.

Other news that I have, are, I'm now actively looking for a new job, since I might get layedoff according to some work sources, so I have been applying for new companies, and have been doing code-challenges here and there.

Because of this bug, I haven't been able to continue my learning of Rust / Golang but will pick it back up since I know have a working computer.

Anyways, that is it for this week update.
