These past few weeks have been for some updating on the VWizard, most notably, I re-structure a bit the Astro.Js template to allow the default page template and the blog template, I also started the Nuxt + Pocketbase template, that is still in development, as I still need to test it a bit more.

### Job Hunting
I'm still job hunting, I've been having lots of interviews, so thats good, but it hasn't gotten to the job offer part, so fingers cross ...

### Japanese
Because I have been busy with my current work, I haven't had the time to update my japanese blog, I still have some stuff to publish from my list of posts, but I haven't had the time to actually do the translation.

### More side projects
Yes... I have another side project I'm thinking of, but I'm still evaluating how to do it, since it involves storing files, that involves security, and because its a side-project, I don't really want to be put too much services.. that is the why of the Nuxt+Pocketbase template, I'm thinking of using pocketbase as a starting point and see where it goes from there.

### New Kick and Youtube Channel
I started doing kick.com streamings, they're pretty boring, since I don't stream audio, only video </br>

and I also opened a youtube channel, I only have one video on how to use VWizard, but once I get the hang on how to edit videos, I'll upload a bitm more.</br>

I'm also contemplating the idea of another youtube channel for my japanese studies.. but that idea is still in the oven, I want that channel to be a bit different, since it will be from a japanese student perspective.
