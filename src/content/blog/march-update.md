### A bit of Update

I haven't posted in weeks, because I was a bit busy, and because of the cold weather, I got the flu, but I'm all right now, and that is why I'm updating the blog today.

### Blog Enhancements

Before getting sick, I got to work on a bit of enhacement on the blog, I've finally added the `tags` page, it was not as easy as I initially thought, I had to download one of the astro templates that had the tags functionality, and copy-paste their parsing functions in order to get it to work, its working right now, and I think I`ll leave it as is for now.

I also added SEO metadata to the layout, that took me a while to understand because I've always worked with frameworks that had SEO ready, in fact this post will be the 1st to test the final implementation of the SEO layout.

### Personal Side Project

They say, that having a side-project is good for programmers, and while I was sick, I came up with an idea for a personal side project that if realized, will help me on my japanese studies, I don't want to say much right now, because I'm still in the initial stages of the project, but I'll let you know when I have something stable to show.
The Project is a mix of Nuxt 3 and Laravel, its been a while since I worked with Laravel, so I'm re-learning a lot, specially on the frontend part, since I've mostly worked on building Laravel APIs.

That's it for my update, the good news is, I'm still here, and learning tons of stuff, I'll post what I have learned or in this case, re-learned from working with Laravel 10.
