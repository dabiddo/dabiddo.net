As the title says, I have new Job!, and I'm really happy for the opportunity given to me with this new company, they are a young company startup in the field of Real Estate, while my knowledge of the topic is limited, they are eager to teach and I'm eager to learn.

Because of the whole interview process, and the fact that I had to go to a new city for the induction process, I wasn't able to post anything on my blog until today.

My new job, I will still do backend with Laravel, but I will also be learning a bit of devops, which I'm excited to learn.

From the current infrastructure they have, I have identified some potential things I need to learn, some I will be able to post about, others, I will be posting experiments with some fake data that will help me learn in order to improve what we use in the company.

As I said earlier, I'm really happy and excited to learn new things and grow my career even further with this new job.
