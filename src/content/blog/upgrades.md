# Upgrades

I saw on this twitter this week that a new version of frankenPHP was released, it had a lot of fixes and introduces the new version with debian trixie, so this weekend, I will test it to see how it works and if all runs OK, I will upgrade the `larabox` image to use this new version of frankenPHP.

# Self Hosting
I don't usually do selfhosting because I don't have spare computers that I can use, but because my raindrop.io account reach a limit, I had to migrate to something else, after a bit of searching I came across [karakeep](https://karakeep.app/), seemed like a good alternative and I liked the UI, plus it has existing extensions for both chrome and firefox, so I'm now self-hosting a personal instance of karakeep in docker ... this reduces a bit of ram because the container is ran 24/7 but whenever I need more ram or space, I just shut it down.

# Social Activity
I've been trying to post more on social media, specially on my mastodon accounts, seems like twitter is becoming to political for my taste so I want to move a way and just stick to the things I like, which is programming and dinosaurs .. lately I've just been posting php and laravel articles on my mastodon account and feel like there is no chatter about political things, I like the peace and quietness ..hope it continues that way.
