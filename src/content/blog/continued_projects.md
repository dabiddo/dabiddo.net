This is just a small update on my personal projects.

Because I'm still adjusting to my new job, I haven't been able to update my projects as much as I want to, but today I did a small update on the `devcontainer` project to add a new Laravel-PGSQL template, during the week I was reading laravel-news and came upon this [article](https://laravel-news.com/prepare-your-laravel-app-for-the-cloud)

Taking the `compose.yml` file as example and what I had on my laravel-mysql template, I created the new pgsql template, I also added the `SERVER_NAME` because my templates use frankenPHP as base, and it worked from the first try, I still have some testing to do before I can send the template to the `main` branch, but for now the image is building without issues.

As for the Japanese blog, I'm struggling a bit with japanese, I'm starting to forget grammar rules, and vocabulary because I haven't had the time to do any studying, with that said, I'm thinking of using some flashcards to brush on my vocab and basic grammar rules, because of this I did not want to update the blog, but I do have some new topics to share.

Read you next time!
