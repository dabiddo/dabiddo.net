### Hello!

I'm Dabiddo, a Mexican Software Engineer,<br>
I like reading mangas, watching anime, spend time with my family and of course programming.

I'm making this site in the hopes of learning more frontend development and new technologies.
Currently I'm studying japanese with the hope of landing a job and live sometime in Japan, as I like the culture and the contrast between their big cities and the temples.

I'm not very active on social media, with the exception of <a href="https://twitter.com/dabiddokun" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, I usually spend some free time there reading posts about technology, and the japanese language.
