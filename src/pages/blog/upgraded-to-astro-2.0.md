# I Upgraded

As you can see for the new website, I changed the theme, Im now using TerminalCSS , but the real highlight is, I'm now using
Astro 2.0.

As followed by the official guide, I did not see any broken changes, my upgrade was easy, and I can see netlify builds getting faster.


## What I've accomplished

1. **Upgrade To Astro 2.0**: Followed the official docs

2. **Change Layout**: Change the layout to use `TerminalCss` .

3. **Making Blog Posts**: With the new CSS, I had to create new layouts for the blog

## What's next

I still need to change the `about` page, and the `tags` page for the blog, but overall, I like it.
