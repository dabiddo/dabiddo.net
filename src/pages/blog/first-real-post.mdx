## Welcome

This is the place where I will post random stuff I learn from the internet, hope you like it.

As you can see, I'm not very good at designing websites, since I mostly work on the backend, so my purpose for doing this page is to practice
and learn more stuff about frontend technology.







## Astro.Build

This site is made using the new '<a href="#">Astro.Build</a>' framework, I chose to use this new framewor because it seemed easy to use and there
was a ready made blog template.


## What's next?

I still have a long way to modify this site, and make it look more usable. for this first iteration, I just concentrated on getting Astro, TailwindCss & DaisyUI to
work together.
