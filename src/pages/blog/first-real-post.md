### Welcome

This is the place where I will post random stuff I learn from the internet, hope you like it.

As you can see, I'm not very good at designing websites, since I mostly work on the backend, so my purpose for doing this page is to practice
and learn more stuff about frontend technology.

### Astro.build

This site is made using the new '<a href="#">Astro.Build</a>' framework, I chose to use this new framework because it seemed easy to use and there
was a blog template I could use to both make this blog and lear about this technology.


### What's next?

I still have lots of pending stuff for site to make it more usable. for this first iteration, I just focused on getting Astro, TailwindCSS & DaisyUI to
work together.
